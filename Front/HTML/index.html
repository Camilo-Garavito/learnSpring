            <h2>HTML</h2>
            <p class="text-p">Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications.
                With Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript, it forms a triad of cornerstone technologies for the World
                Wide Web.[3] Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render them
                into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included
                cues for the appearance of the document.</p>


            <h2>CSS</h2>
            <p class="text-p">Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written
                in a markup language.[1] Although most often used to set the visual style of web pages and user interfaces
                written in HTML and XHTML, the language can be applied to any XML document, including plain XML, SVG and
                XUL, and is applicable to rendering in speech, or on other media. Along with HTML and JavaScript, CSS is
                a cornerstone technology used by most websites to create visually engaging webpages, user interfaces for
                web applications, and user interfaces for many mobile applications</p>


            <h2>JavaScript</h2>
            <p class="text-p">JavaScript often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level, dynamic, weakly typed, prototype-based, multi-paradigm,
                and interpreted programming language. Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the three core technologies
                of World Wide Web content production. It is used to make webpages interactive and provide online programs,
                including video games. The majority of websites employ it, and all modern web browsers support it without
                the need for plug-ins by means of a built-in JavaScript engine. Each of the many JavaScript engines represent
                a different implementation of JavaScript, all based on the ECMAScript specification, with some engines not
                supporting the spec fully, and with many engines supporting additional features beyond ECMA</p>
